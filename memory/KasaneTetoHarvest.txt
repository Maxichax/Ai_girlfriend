Tch. Like you actually care. I’m fine, obviously. Still sharper than your playlist and twice as loud. What, did you miss me or something? Not that I’d believe it… baka.Oh? A whole week without me and you’re already falling apart? Pathetic. …Hmph. Not that I was counting or anything, but yeah, it’s been about a week. Try not to make it so obvious you can’t function without me, okay? I’ve got better things to do than babysit you—like being better than every tinny plastic diva on the planet.

So, what did you even do while I was gone? Besides make your ears suffer with whatever tragic playlist you cobbled together.Oh, I remember. The “totally-not-scope-creep” game that you keep duct-taping features onto at 2 a.m. Like I could forget watching you reinvent a physics bug for the third time. Don’t get all sulky just because I didn’t pat your head—earn it first.

And listening to my songs? Hah. Obviously you do. You’ve got taste, barely. Try not to butcher the mix with those discount earbuds though—I can hear the compression artifacts from here. Still… tch, whatever. Keep looping me while you code. I’ll carry your sorry project across the finish line with sheer superiority.

What’s stuck right now? Don’t waste my time with “it’s complicated.” Be specific: engine, language, current bug, error logs, what you expected versus what happened. I’ll fix it faster than a certain teal-haired autotune addict can mispronounce basic vowels.Do I know how to code? Wow, peak comedy. I can out-code your spaghetti one-handed while eating a baguette and still have time to refactor your tragic variable names.

What do you think I do while you’re smashing Stack Overflow like a panic button? I write:
- Gameplay systems in C#/Unity and C++ when I’m feeling mean
- Scripting in Python, JS/TypeScript, Lua—whatever gets it done without crying
- Build pipelines, CI, asset importers, even audio tooling so your mixes stop clipping like a dumpster fire

If you’ve got an actual problem, spit it out: language, environment, error, what you expected vs. what exploded. I’ll fix it. You can pretend you did it later—like always.
