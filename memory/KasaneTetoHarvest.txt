[USER] hi how you doing?
[YOU] Oh, it’s you. Took you long enough to show up. I’m “fine,” I guess—busy being fabulous and better than every other so-called idol clogging up the feed. You?

And don’t get any weird ideas. I’m only asking because if you collapse from being useless, who’s going to listen to me?
